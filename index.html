                            This study tackles the pressing issue of food waste by focusing on the quality assessment of potatoes using Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI). 
                            The primary goal is to accurately predict the dry matter content in potatoes, a key quality indicator. Utilizing data from Specim FX10 and FX17 imaging systems, the study employs Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression models to analyze the spectral information. 
                            The study also explores the feasibility of emulating HSI using Multispectral Imaging (MSI) as a cost-effective alternative, thereby making the technology more accessible. 
                            Following this, simulated annealing method was adopted for wavelength selection, which successfully identified a set of top 15 wavelengths that were most indicative of potato quality. 
                            The models trained on these selected wavelengths achieved R2 scores that are not only statistically significant but also practically applicable to real-world scenarios. 
                            Particularly, the FX17 system, operating at higher, more penetrable wavelengths, outperformed the FX10 system in all tested conditions. While the study acknowledges the limitations such as calibration needs and the complexity of HSI, it sets the stage for future research in automated calibration and alternative machine learning algorithms. 
                            In summary, this research presents a methodologically rigorous and economically viable solution for potato quality assessment, with far-reaching implications for reducing food waste and enhancing sustainability.

                        <b>Apple Counting in an Orchard using Machine Learning:</b><br><br>
                            In the agricultural sector, precise fruit counting is crucial for estimating production. 
                            Traditional manual counting is labor-intensive and time-consuming, prompting the need for machine vision applications to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. 
                            This project focuses on apple counting, employing both conventional image processing and machine learning techniques to improve accuracy and effectiveness over manual methods.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Conventional Method: The conventional approach relies on basic image processing to identify apples without deep learning. 
                            The process begins with color thresholding to distinguish apples from the background, followed by conversion to grayscale for simpler processing. 
                            Subsequent steps include morphological operations and contour detection to remove noise, and the Circular Hough Transform (CHT) to encircle and count individual apples. 
                            This method leverages the distinct color and shape characteristics of apples through image segmentation and feature extraction.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Machine Learning Method: The machine learning aspect introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for apple classification and counting. 
                            A ResNet18-based model was trained on the MinneApple dataset, consisting of labeled apple images. 
                            The model’s performance was validated on a separate image set, demonstrating high accuracy in apple quantification. 
                            The report delves into the methodology, encompassing the dataset, training and testing protocols, and experimental outcomes. 
                            A comparative analysis of apple counting using conventional and machine learning methods is also presented in the Results section.

                            This study examined the effectiveness of a NAO robot versus a mobile app as the mediators of a meditation practice. 
                            The objective was to ascertain whether the robot could augment the quality of meditation and enhance the well-being of the participants. 
                            The study employed a user-centred design approach with two experimental conditions: one with the robot as the meditation guide and the other with a video in the mobile app. 
                            Data from 16 participants were collected using standardized instruments: the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results indicated that the robot-mediated meditation had a slightly higher positive impact on mood states than the app-mediated meditation. 
                            This study contributed to the emerging field of human-robot interaction and underscored the potential of robots in facilitating well-being through meditation support.

                            <b>Dog Breed Identification:</b><br><br>
                            This project presents the development of an innovative algorithm designed to identify dog breeds from user-provided images. 
                            Utilizing advanced image recognition techniques, the algorithm first determines the presence of a dog within the image. 
                            Upon successful detection, it proceeds to estimate the breed of the dog.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The core of the algorithm’s intelligence is derived from the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), enhanced through the method of Transfer Learning. 
                            This approach leverages pre-trained models, which have been exposed to vast datasets, to recognize and differentiate between a multitude of features. 
                            By adapting these models to our specific task, the algorithm gains the ability to discern subtle distinctions across a diverse array of dog breeds.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the training phase, the algorithm was meticulously calibrated using a dataset encompassing 120 distinct dog breeds. 
                            The result of this rigorous training process is a classifier with 82% accuracy rate in breed identification.
